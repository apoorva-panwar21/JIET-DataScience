OBJECTIVE: TO DISCOVER WHICH MUTUAL FUNDS SCHEME IS MORE STABLE AND BENEFICIAL FOR FUTURE INVESTMENTS FOR SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD

OUR ANALYSIS: ANALYSIS ON THE SIMILAR SCHEMES FOR LARGE CAP REGULAR GROWTH FOR DIFFERENT MUTUAL FUNDS.

OUR ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE LARGE CAP REG GROWTH OF SIMILAR SCHEMES FOR FOLLOWING MUTUAL FUNDS:-
>>KOTAK BLUECHIP FUND
>>CANARA ROBECO BLUECHIP EQUITY FUND
>>IDFC LARGE CAP FUND
>>MIRAE ASSET LARGE CAP FUND

THE DATA FOR ALL THE FOUR SCHEMES WAS FETCHED THROUGH API OF THE MUTUAL FUNDS FOR THE MENTIONED SCHEMES.

SECONDLY, WE PLOTTED THE GROWTH ANALYSIS OF THESE SCHEMES TO FIND OUT WHICH MF HAS SHOWN A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF INCREASING GROWTH OVER
A PERIOD OF 5 YEARS.

THEN, WE CALUCLATED THE RETURNS FROM THESE SCHEMES AND DID INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS OVER THEM.

THE Net asset value (NAV) represents a fund's per share market value hence is an important factor so we first calculated and then visualized the NAV for the FOUR SCHEMES through FLOURISH.


EACH OF THE VISUALIZATION AND CALCULATION IS DONE DYNAMICALLY THROUGH API.
